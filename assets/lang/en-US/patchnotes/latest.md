## Update version no. 0.22.3
## Release date: 19/12/2023 (19th December, 2023)

# Changelog:

As you can see, new patch notes format, now in markdown! Externally, the "patch notes" will be now called the "changelog".

### What's changed?

The main file has been revamped, as well as the command registering feature! Don't worry, no commands should be effected by this, as it only was a change in the internal registry of commands. This shortened the code by +/- 50 lines. Oh and remember that before the multi-guild registration wasn't working? Yeah, that's solved.

#### Introduced new Update Messages

Now you should be notified whenever a new update dropped, and have a link to the its' changelog.
This was done with some, we'll call them "special measures" using github's RAW data API. This actually took like triple the time I expected it to take.

### Language

Adicionally, new translations have been added for both english and portuguese.
