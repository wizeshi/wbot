New Version: 0.22.0
Release date: 05/10/2023 (5th October, 2023)

Patch notes:

    New customConsole class implemented, replacing the customConsoleLog function.
    New customConsole.update function: Instead of creating new messages in the console, it uses an array of characters to, over a select period of time, update the message.
    Ready unban function fully fixed for the time being
    Lyrics command fixed, just had to create new pages if the text was too long (really discord?)
    

Known Bugs:

    Working on implementing translations to other languages, as well as finishing the translations for current ones.
    customConsole.update sometimes flashes? Maybe its because the updates are too fast?
    Ban & unban commands still sortof broken?
